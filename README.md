# Tomato-plant-disease-detection
Tomato plant disease detection using Raspberry Pi and Machine Learning

In this project we have written a machine learning algorithm which detects diseases on a tomato leaf.

The code we have written to train the machine learning algorithm can be seen in "tt_3.ipynb".
The other file "check.ipynb" is used to test the algorithm.

The dataset used for this project - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf

The image "output1.png" shows the implementation of this machine learning algorithm on a Raspberry Pi with which we have interfaced a camera module to capture images of the leaf.
